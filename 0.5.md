0.5: Single page app diagram

Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user goes to the single-page app version of the notes app at https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.

Browser->>Server: THe user types the address into the broswer. The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the server at the address https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.

Server->>Browser: The server responds by sending the HTML code for the page. The response also contains the style sheet and JS code for the page.

 SPA-style websites don't fetch all of their pages separately from the server like our sample application does, but instead comprise only one HTML page fetched from the server, the contents of which are manipulated with JavaScript that executes in the browser. The page is not reloaded when the user navigates to a different part of the application, but the JavaScript code running in the browser changes the contents of the page accordingly.
